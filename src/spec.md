# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Home page hero to prominently show the game title, studio name, developer credits, and release window, and set the browser tab title to “Axses”.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Home hero layout so “Axses” appears centered near the top as the most prominent text.
- Add a centered, readable credits block near the bottom of the Home hero with: “Developer: Rohan Kadam”, “Solo Game Developer”, “Studying FY BSc (Game Developer)”, and “Release Window: 2027–2028”.
- Display “Night Magic” on the Home hero in italic styling with a red text color.
- Set the document/browser tab title (HTML `<title>`) to “Axses”.

**User-visible outcome:** On the Home page first screen, users see “Axses” prominently near the top, “Night Magic” in red italic text, and a clear developer/release window block near the bottom; the browser tab title shows “Axses”.
